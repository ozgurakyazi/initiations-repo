# initiations-repo
Because I forget how to initiate different projects, like a django project, I wanted to create a repo which stores those quick and dirty information so that I do not have to lose time finding a tutorial. 

1- Django

All the information about django initiation is taken from https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/ .
